# Cross-correlation-calculator
Cross-Correlation calculator sample code. 
Correlation is a mathematical operation that is very similar to convolution. Just as with convolution, correlation uses two signals to produce a third signal. This third signal is called the cross-correlation of the two input signals. 
Since this signal reversal is the only difference between the two operations, it is possible to represent correlation using the same mathematics as convolution. This requires preflipping one of the two signals being correlated.
